##### Module #####
- Example: 
    import sys
    sys.path.append('/home/trang/working/projects/Machine-Learning/data_scrapping/')
- Due to Vscode as known as runtime application. So when running testing in a specific file and call to parent 
Module/packages or another packages. We should add import sys.path in the top file.
- For whole project, we just run the main file and main file should in root direction, this makes python treat the
current direction in list of modules in sys.path. When root direction is inserted, every files of project can call all packages
even they are in different directions.
